| T3: Filter & Delete | 0 (1/1)     | 0 (2/2)      | 0       |

|---------------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| T1: Add Task        | 5            | 4.5           | 4.75    |

| T3: Filter & Delete | 5            | 5             | 5       |

**Interpretation**: T1 (add task) lower confidence was due to "not being used to this website", other T2 (edit inline) is the only issue.
