# Evidence Chains — Week 9

## Chain 1: No Confirmation in No-JS Path

**Raw data**: P2 (No-JS) said "There isn't any confirmation for my actions."

**Finding**: No-JS participants lack confidence because webapp shows no explicit success message.

**WCAG**: 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA) - Not error, but related (success feedback equally important)

## Chain 2: Edit Button Not Working

**Raw data**: P2 and P3 all hesitated on Edit (pilot notes timestamps show over minute pause for this)

**Finding**: "Edit" label doesn't work and will only reload page when clicked on.

**WCAG**: 2.4.3 Focus Order (AA) - web page can be navigated sequentially, with meaning and operation
